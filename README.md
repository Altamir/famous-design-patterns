# Intorduction

This repository contains famous design patterns written in C#.NET.

At the root of the repository you may find a brief digest of each of the three design pattern books, namely *Gang Of Four*, *Patterns in Action* and *Head First: Design Patterns*. You can also find various implementations of each book's described designed pattern under a directory with the book's name.

## Where to start

To start take a look at the [**Getting Started**](Getting+Started+4.5.pdf) document.

## Contribution

Since the implementations might be a little out of date with the most current technology stacks and platforms (i.e. dotnet core, C# 7.x upwards, etc.) any contributions on implementing these patterns with the newer technologies and platforms are greatly appreciated.
